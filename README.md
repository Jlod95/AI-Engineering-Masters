# [Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Companies from Newspaper Headlines](https://github.com/Jlod95/Data-Science-Projects)
* Scrapped Finviz website for headlines using Beautiful Soup
* Used nltk to carry out sentiment analysis on headlines
* Used pandas and matplotlib to visualise the data

# Project 2: EDA with Python and Logistic Regression - Titanic
* Simply project for practicing EDA and Data Visualisation techniques
* Used Logistic Regression Model. Logistic model is just Linear Regression under a transform, usually a Sigmoid function
* It is used when we want to examine a binary dependent variable relationship with one or more independent variables
* Used a classification report as well, which contains precision, recall, f1-score
* Precision is a good evaluation metric to use when the cost of a false positive is very high
* Recall calculates the percentage of actual positives a model correctly identified
* The  F1-score, is a measure of a model's accuracy on a dataset, it is a combination of precision and recall, and would be most appropriate in this case
